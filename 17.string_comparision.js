//Compare of different types

console.log("a" < "b") //true 

console.log("a" < "A") //false

console.log("a" > 2) //false

console.log("glow" > "glee") //true becouse string comparison operator scans each character of word1("glow") to word2("glee") like "gl" is common where in word1 "o" is greater than word2 "e"  and "w"(word1) is greater than "e" (word2) like this it scans and so on..if any one is greater char in glee then it will be false

console.log("a" > 2) //false

console.log("5" > 5) //false
